# FORDS OF BELLMAN:
## A smart cart - Based on Walmart's Problem Statement in Hackfest2k19, IIT(ISM) Dhanbad

We have designed a **Smart Cart** which attempts to provide the customer a **trouble-free** shopping experience.

The cart has attached to it a *QR code scanner* which scans the items or products placed on the platform of the cart. Once the product is scanned the platform rotates(through its servo motor) & the product slides onto the bottom of the cart and also the details of the scanned products is shown to the users on screen. Finally the customers can checkout by paying for the items he has on his list.
